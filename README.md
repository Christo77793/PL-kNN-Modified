# PL-kNN (Performance with different Angle Thresholds)

This repository contains a modified version of the source code of PL-kNN, which is a model proposed to bypass the choice of the k parameter of the standard k-NN classifier. Our modified
code compares the accuracy for <u>different angle thresholds</u> which we've discovered plays a part in how the model performs.

The original PL-kNN model is based on the Smallest Modified k-Nearest Neighbors (SMKNN) presented by Ayyad et al. in the following paper:

**Ayyad, S. M., Saleh, A. I., & Labib, L. M. (2019). Gene expression cancer classification using modified K-Nearest Neighbors technique. *Biosystems*, 176, 41-51.**

# Usage

The proposed model was aimed to be easy to implement and so to use it just clone the code and run it. The specific seed values we used to obtain our results are:

* Train-Test Split 75:25 Seed 5 & 13
* Train-Test Split 80:20 Seed 5 & 9
