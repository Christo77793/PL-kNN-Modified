# PL-kNN (Performance with different Angle Thresholds)

This repository contains a modified version of the source code of PL-kNN, a model proposed to bypass the choice of the k parameter of the standard k-NN classifier. Our code compares the
accuracy for different angle thresholds which also plays a part in how the model performs.

The proposed model is based on the Smallest Modified k-Nearest Neighbors (SMKNN) presented by Ayyad et al. in the following paper:

**Ayyad, S. M., Saleh, A. I., & Labib, L. M. (2019). Gene expression cancer classification using modified K-Nearest Neighbors technique. *Biosystems*, 176, 41-51.**

# Usage

The proposed model was aimed to be easy to implement and so to use it just download the code and run it.
